# In-Situ-Water-Quality-Sensor
An in situ water quality sensor for monitoring water quality

Mohamad, clean thie up. 

## V0.1
1. Measures pH and turbidity 
1. Saves data to SD card
1. Water-tight case 
1. This is a general dump of all the initial files. 

## V0.2
1. This is just a clean up version of 0.0.1. 
1. The pads on the 1026 resistors are too small
1. move SMA connection over.
1. Need to add ground plane to V0.0.3.
1. Need to add SMA footprint on V0.0.3.

## V0.3
1. This will be the new boards you order. 



## V 0.4.0
1. Includes part designs necessary to assmeble water sensor package.
2. Missing probe protector.
3. Missing apple air tag mount.
4. Need to adjust hold positioning for Solar Flap Fixture.


## V 0.4.5 
1. Includes 2 component holders. One for TDS and pH, and another for TDS, pH, and Turbidity.
2. Includes a probe protector that prevent damage to the ends of the probes.
3. Updated solar flaps to house solar flaps wired in parallel
4. Solar Flap Fixture Cap updated to include a spot for apple air tag
5. Updated Solar Flap Fixture. (position for holes moved, height extended, and inside tabs reduced from 4 to 2)
6. Need to make these parts out of a solid plastic pieces and leak test the package.
7. PCB Design includes RTC Module, Micro SD Card Module.
8. The PCB includes Footprints for the PH, TDS and Turbidity Sensors.
9. Updated Arduino code to Measures the PH, TDS and Turbidity of the water.
10. The code controls the sampling time and save the collected data on a micro SD card.
