# System Development for the In Situ Water Quality Sensor
An in situ water quality sensor for monitoring water quality

## V0.1
1. Measures pH and turbidity 
1. Saves data to SD card
1. Water-tight case 
1. This is a general dump of all the initial files. 

## V0.2
1. This is just a clean-up version of 0.1. 
1. The pads on the 1026 resistors are too small
1. move the SMA connection over.
1. Need to add a ground plane to V0.3.
1. Need to add the SMA footprint on V0.3.

## V0.3
1. New designs for PCB boards. 



## V 0.4.0
1. Includes part designs necessary to assemble the water sensor package.
2. Missing probe protector.
3. Missing Apple air tag mount.
4. Need to adjust hold positioning for Solar Flap Fixture.


## V 0.4.5 
1. Includes 2 component holders. One for TDS and pH, and another for TDS, pH, and Turbidity.
2. Includes a probe protector that prevents damage to the ends of the probes.
3. Updated solar flaps to house solar flaps wired in parallel
4. Solar Flap Fixture Cap updated to include a spot for Apple air tag
5. Updated Solar Flap Fixture. (position for holes moved, height extended, and inside tabs reduced from 4 to 2)
6. Need to make these parts out of solid plastic pieces and leak-test the package.
7. PCB Design includes RTC Module and Micro SD Card Module.
8. The PCB includes Footprints for the PH, TDS, and Turbidity Sensors.
9. Updated Arduino code to Measure the PH, TDS, and Turbidity of the water.
10. The code controls the sampling time and saves the collected data on a micro SD card.

## V 0.4.6 
1. These are general updates and a major reorganization of all the files in V0.4.5.
2. The updated PCB design includes footprints pH, Turbidity, TDS, and Temperature sensors.
3. The Updated Arduino code.
4. The Kriging Code
