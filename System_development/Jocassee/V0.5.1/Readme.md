## Instructions for the In-Situ Water Quality Sensor Deployment and RecoveryShape <br>

### Deployment <br>

* Upload the code and monitor the sensor readings. 

* Insert the SD card. 

* Rename the CSV file according to the sensor package number within the arduino IDE. 

* Turn the switch off. 

* Install the battery. 

* Turn the switch on. 

* Check the red signal on the board. 

* Assemble the outer case and the sensor package, put grease on the O-ring. 

* Remove the pH probe cover Tape the inside of the bottom protective red cover. 

* Mount the bottom cover. 

### Recovery 

* Rinse the entire sensor package with tap water and wipe it dry. 

* Remove the bottom cover. 

* Rinse the sensor probes with filtered or distilled water, sepcially the pH probe. 

* Separate the outer case from the sensor package. 

* Turn the switch off. 

* Reattach the storage solution tube to the pH probe and store it properly. 

* Remove the battery. 

* Remove the SD card. 

* Check the recorded data. 

### Note: pH probe storage solution needs to be changed every 2 storage cycles.
